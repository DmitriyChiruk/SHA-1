Programm code was created in Visual Studio on Windows
so in other platforms may be needed to add '#include "SHA1.cpp"'
to Main.cpp.

### EXTERNAL LIBS ###
External implementation of sha-1 function was taken from 
boost/compute/detail/sha1.hpp, therefore boosty lib has to be
installed and connected to the project.
